A quick analysis on movie duration and ratings

In this project we analyse a few aspects of this dataset containing the Top 1000 highest grossing movies of all time.

On the first graph we can see the 10 longest movies from the list.
We can see that the highest grossing movies of all time are not too long, since the longest ones are from 180-200 minutes.

On the second graph we can see the scatter graph showing the relation between rating and duration.
Highlited in the picture we can see the average movie is rated at around 6.8 and a duration of 120 minutes.
